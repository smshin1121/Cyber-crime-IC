  CVE-2026-35503  
 
 A vulnerability in the X3050's web management interface allows authentication logic to be performed entirely on the client side, relying on hardcoded values within browser-executed scripts rather than server-side verification. An attacker with access to the login page could retrieve these exposed parameters and gain unauthorized access to administrative functionality.

  CVE-2026-39462  
 
 A vulnerability exists in the X3050's web management interface in which password updates are not reliably applied due to improper handling of credential changes on the backend. After the device undergoes a factory restore using the SenseLive Config 2.0 tool, the interface may indicate that the password update was successful; however, the system may continue to accept the previous or default credentials, demonstrating that the password-change process is not consistently enforced. Even after a factory reset, attempted password changes may fail to propagate correctly.

  CVE-2026-27843  
 
 A vulnerability exists in the X3050's web management interface that allows critical configuration parameters to be modified without sufficient authentication or server-side validation. By applying unsupported or disruptive values to recovery mechanisms and network settings, an attacker can induce a persistent lockout state. Because the device lacks a physical reset button, recovery requires specialized technical access via the console to perform a factory reset, resulting in a total denial-of-service for the gateway and its connected RS-485 downstream systems.

  CVE-2026-40431  
 
 A vulnerability exists in the X3050's web management interface due to its reliance on unencrypted HTTP for all administrative communication. Because management traffic, including authentication attempts and configuration data, is transmitted in cleartext, an attacker with access to the same network segment could intercept or observe sensitive operational information.

  CVE-2026-40623  
 
 A vulnerability in the X3050's web management interface allows critical system and network configuration parameters to be modified without sufficient validation and safety controls. Due to inadequate enforcement of constraints on sensitive functions, parameters such as IP addressing, watchdog timers, reconnect intervals, and service ports can be set to unsupported or unsafe values. These configuration changes directly affect core device behaviour and recovery mechanisms. The lack of proper validation and safeguards allows critical system functions to be altered in a manner that can destabilize device operation or render the device persistently unavailable.

Because the application does not enforce server-side validation of request origin or implement CSRF tokens, a malicious external webpage could cause a user's browser to submit unauthorized configuration requests to the device.

 A vulnerability in the X3050's management ecosystem allows unauthenticated discovery of deployed units through the vendor's management protocol, enabling identification of device presence, identifiers, and management interfaces without requiring credentials. Because discovery functions are exposed by the underlying service rather than gated by authentication, an attacker on the same network segment can rapidly enumerate targeted devices.

 Recommended Practices 
 CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. 
 Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet. 
 Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks. 
 When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. 
 CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. 
 CISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. 
 CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets. 
 Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies. 
 Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. 
 CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks: 
 Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages. 
 Refer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams. 
 Refer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks. 
 No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.
